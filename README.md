## Abstract
The objective of this project is to implement a fault-tolerant distributed transac- tion processing system that supports a simple banking application. To this end, we partition servers into multiple clusters where each cluster maintains a data shard. Each data shard is replicated on all servers of a cluster to provide fault tolerance. The sys- tem supports two types of transactions: intra-shard and cross-shard. An intra-shard transaction accesses the data items of the same shard while a cross-shard transaction accesses the data items on multiple shards. To process intra-shard transactions the modified Paxos protocol implemented in the first project (or the Multi-Paxos proto- col) should be used while the two-phase commit protocol is used to process cross-shard transactions.
